**Title:** Full React Tutorial #32 - 404 Pages & Next Steps (128kbit_AAC-English).mp3

**Overview:**
In this tutorial, we learn how to create a 404 (not found) component in a React project and set up a catch-all route to display it for invalid routes. The `NotFound` component is a stateless functional component with a simple template. To display the 404 component when a user tries to access an invalid route, we add a catch-all route in `app.js`. Improving the design and style of the 404 page is encouraged as it falls outside the scope of this React course. The lecture series also provides automatic closed captions that can be accessed in the video description section.

**Main Ideas:**
1. Creating a 404 (not found) component named `NotFound`.
2. Adding a catch-all route in `app.js` for displaying the `NotFound` component.
3. Improving the design and style of the 404 page.
4. Future plans for advanced React tutorials, including potentially React with Firebase authentication.
5. Automatic closed captions provided in the lecture series.
6. Encouragement to continue with future courses in the series.

**Key Manipulations and Scripting/Coding:**
1. Create a new component named `NotFound`.
2. Define the structure of the `NotFound` component using JSX.
3. Import the created `NotFound` component into `app.js`.
4. Add a catch-all route in `app.js` with an asterisk (`*`) as its path, to be added at the bottom of existing routes.
5. Use React Router to render the `NotFound` component for invalid routes.

**Questions:**
1. How could you improve the design and style of the 404 page in this tutorial?
2. In what ways can you use a catch-all route to enhance your application's user experience?
3. What do you think could be the benefits of learning React with Firebase authentication in future courses?
