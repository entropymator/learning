# Full React Tutorial #9 - Intro to React Dev Tools (128kbit_AAC-English)

## Overview
This tutorial introduces you to the React Developer Tools extension, a powerful tool that integrates with browser development tools and provides additional features for debugging and exploring React applications. By understanding how to use this extension effectively, you can enhance your ability to develop, test, and debug complex React applications.

## Main Ideas
1. Component Diagram or Component Tree: Visual representation of the current application's components, with hover-over information available.
2. Source File Information: Pinpoint specific component locations within their root files.
3. Logging Component Data: Log all data about a component, including props, DOM nodes, and the location of the file.
4. Viewing Component Source File in DevTools: Inspect associated JavaScript files for further inspection, as well as state and hooks information for each component.
5. Practical Application: Utilize React Developer Tools in hands-on exploration, experimentation, observing prop values, and collaborating during relevant lessons.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting/Coding Used
1. Install the React Developer Tools extension on Chrome or Firefox.
2. Navigate to a React application and open browser development tools.
3. Access the 'Components' tab in the extended DevTools for a visual representation of the app’s components.
4. Click on specific components for more information, including their source file location, logging component data, and viewing associated JavaScript files.
