# Full React Tutorial #28 - Submit Events (128kbit_AAC-English)

## Overview

This session focuses on handling form submissions in JavaScript within the context of a React application. The tutorial covers creating event listeners, preventDefault(), and sending HTTP requests to add data to JSON Server.

## Main Ideas

1. Triggering submit events on forms and attaching a handleSubmit function to manage the event.
2. Preventing page refresh upon form submission by using event.preventDefault().
3. Creating JavaScript objects for handling data manipulation.
4. Planning a POST request to an endpoint provided by JSON Server to add new objects to stored data.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting Used

- Attaching event listeners (in this case, `onSubmit`) to the form.
- Creating functions (`handleSubmit`) to handle events.
- Preventing the default action of an event using the `event.preventDefault()` method.
- Creating JavaScript objects for data manipulation.
- Sending HTTP requests (POST) to add data to a server (JSON Server).
