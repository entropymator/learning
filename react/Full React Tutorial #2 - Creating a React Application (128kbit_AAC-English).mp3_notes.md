==================================================================================

Overview

----------

1. Using `npx create-react-app` to start a new React project
2. Understanding the file structure and key components in a React project
3. Running local development server, live reload server, and managing dependencies with `package.json`

Key Manipulations and Scripting or Coding Used
-----------------------------------------------

1. Requiring Node version 5.2 or above for running npx commands
2. Using terminal commands to navigate directories (`cd`) and create a React project (`npx create-react-app projectName`)
3. Utilizing scripts in `package.json` to preview the application in a browser (`npm start`), build for production, test, or eject webpack files
4. Reinstalling the `node_modules` folder using `npm install` command after downloading a project

Reflective or Quiz-style Questions
-----------------------------------

1. What is the purpose of using `create-react-app` when starting a new React project?
2. Which file serves the application to the browser in a React project, and where is the `App` component injected into this file?
3. Describe the role of the `package.json` file in managing dependencies and running scripts for tasks within a React project.
