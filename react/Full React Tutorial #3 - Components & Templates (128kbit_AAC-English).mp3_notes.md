# Full React Tutorial #3 - Components & Templates (128kbit_AAC-English)

## Overview

In this tutorial, we will delve into the fundamental building blocks of React applications: components. We'll explore how to create and manage components, using JSX for template creation, and discuss the role of Babel in transpiling our templates during file saves.

## Main Ideas

* Components are self-contained sections of content that form the backbone of a React application.
* The root component is the initial rendering point to the DOM, housing all other components within it.
* JSX is used for creating HTML style templates and components in React, which gets transpiled into HTML by Babel.
* In contrast to HTML, JSX uses `className` instead of `class`.
* Since this lecture is based on a newer version (above 17), there's no need to import React at the top of component files, unlike in older versions like 16.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting or Coding Used

* Writing JavaScript functions to create components and render them to the DOM using JSX.
* Utilizing Babel for transpiling JSX into HTML during file saves.

## Reflective Questions

1. Why is it crucial to use a unique naming convention (e.g., `className`) for classes in JSX compared to traditional HTML?
2. How would you explain the role of Babel when working with React components?
3. In what ways can importing React be necessary in older versions of React, and why is it no longer a requirement in this tutorial's version?
