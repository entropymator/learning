# Full React Tutorial #5 - Multiple Components (128kbit_AAC-English).mp3

## Overview
In this tutorial, we learn about creating and managing multiple components in a React application. We begin by understanding the role of the root component (app.js) and create new components such as navbar and home page content. We discuss key manipulations and scripting used to structure a React project efficiently.

## Main Ideas
1. Understanding the role of the root component (app.js).
2. Creating and naming new components according to their purpose.
3. Defining stateless functional components using JSX syntax.
4. Importing, exporting, and nesting components within other components.
5. Styling components using CSS classes in the JSX templates.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting/Coding Used
1. Creating new files for individual components (e.g., home.js).
2. Defining stateless functional components using JSX syntax, such as `function Home() { ... }`.
3. Importing and exporting components with ES6 import/export statements, e.g., `import home from './home';`.
4. Nesting components inside other components by referencing them within a parent component's render method, e.g., `<Home />`.
5. Using CSS classes to style components in the JSX templates, e.g., `<div className="home">...</div>`.

## Reflective or Quiz-Style Questions
1. What is the role of the root component in a React application?
2. How would you define a new functional component for displaying a list of items?
3. Describe the process of importing, exporting, and nesting components within other components in a React project.
