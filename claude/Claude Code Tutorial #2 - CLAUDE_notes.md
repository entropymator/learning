# Claude Code Tutorial #2 - CLAUDE

## Overview
This tutorial covers the usage of Claude, a coding assistant tool, to manage and create features in your projects. It focuses on initializing and maintaining Claude MD files, understanding types of memory, and adding new memories.

## Main Ideas
1. Initializing a Claude MD file with `claude init` command to provide guidance for Claude Code.
2. Maintaining an updated Claude MD file for better code generation and managing project-specific changes.
3. Creating and placing new features into specified folders using Claude Code.
4. Avoiding `hawk` components when creating new features.
5. Adding memories directly to the Claude MD file within the chat session using a hash symbol (`#`).
6. Saving memories to project memory, local project memory, or global memory for personal and shared usage.
7. Using the `/init` command to add new memories to Project memory and creating a Claude MD file in the root of the project.
8. Accessing memory files using the `memory` command and opening them for editing.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting or Coding Used
1. Using commands like `claude init`, `/init`, and `memory` to interact with Claude Code and manage Claude MD files.
2. Editing Claude MD files manually to outline project structures, tools, packages, frameworks, and code style preferences.
3. Custom scripts or configurations may be added in local project memory for personal tooling.

## Reflective or Quiz-Style Questions
1. Why is it essential to keep the Claude MD file updated?
2. How can you create a new hook using Claude Code and where will it be placed?
3. What are the three types of memory in Claude, and what are their main differences?
4. How would you add a new memory about naming conventions for your project to Claude's Project memory?
5. Explain how you can access and edit your memory files using Claude commands.
