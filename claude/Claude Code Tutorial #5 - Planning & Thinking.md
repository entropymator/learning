# Claude Code Tutorial #5 - Planning & Thinking (128kbit_AAC-English).mp3

In this tutorial, we delve into two capabilities of Cloud Code: planning and thinking. These features allow the AI to suggest solutions and plans before writing any code.

## Main Ideas
1. **Planning Mode**: Initiate planning mode by pressing 'alt + m' twice. This mode is useful for tasks that require wide changes across several files, where each change might not be complex. For instance, creating a custom component for an avatar.
2. **Thinking Mode**: Activate thinking mode by using keywords such as "think" or "think hard". The AI generates a plan when thinking is triggered, providing a proposed solution for a given task, in this case, implementing a comment system.
3. **Vibe Coding**: Break down complex tasks into smaller chunks or individual tasks for easier guidance. This approach is known as "vibe coding".
4. **Levels of Thinking**: The AI model has different levels of thinking that can be activated by using keywords like "think", "think hard", or "ultra think". Using these keywords will consume more tokens as the level of thinking increases.

## Key Manipulations and Scripting/Coding Used
1. To enter planning mode, press 'alt + m' twice.
2. Activate thinking mode by using keywords such as "think" or "think hard".
3. Break down complex tasks into smaller chunks for easier guidance (vibe coding).
4. Update instructions in the Claude.md file to specify project requirements.
5. Use bash commands like 'npm run test' and link files as instructed by the user.

## Reflective or Quiz-Style Questions
1. How can planning mode be activated within Cloud Code?
2. What is the difference between thinking mode and planning mode in Claude Code?
3. Explain a scenario where you would find vibe coding useful when working with Claude Code.
